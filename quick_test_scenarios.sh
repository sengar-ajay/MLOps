# Quick Test Scenarios for GitHub Actions Pipeline

echo "=== GitHub Actions Pipeline Testing Scenarios ==="

echo "
1. TEST CI WORKFLOW (Already Done)
   - Push to feature branch triggers CI
   - Check: https://github.com/[your-repo]/actions

2. TEST MANUAL TRIGGERS
   - Go to Actions tab → Select workflow → Run workflow
   - Test ML Pipeline: Set 'retrain_model' to true
   - Test Maintenance: Set 'security_scan_only' to true

3. TEST CD WORKFLOW - Staging
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main  
   git merge feature/enhancement
   git push origin main
   # This triggers CD workflow with staging deployment

4. TEST CD WORKFLOW - Production  
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'Release v1.0.0'
   git push origin v1.0.0
   # This triggers production deployment

5. TEST ML PIPELINE WITH DATA CHANGE
   echo '# Trigger ML pipeline' >> data/README.md
   git add data/README.md
   git commit -m 'test: trigger ML pipeline'
   git push origin main

6. TEST PULL REQUEST
   git checkout -b test/pr-trigger
   echo '# Test PR' >> PR_TEST.md
   git add PR_TEST.md
   git commit -m 'test: create PR to test CI'
   git push origin test/pr-trigger
   # Then create PR on GitHub

7. MONITOR RESULTS
   # Check GitHub Actions tab for:
   # - Workflow status (success/failure)
   # - Job logs and outputs  
   # - Generated artifacts
   # - Execution time

=== Expected Workflow Behaviors ==="

echo "
CI WORKFLOW should:
✓ Run on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
✓ Execute linting (flake8, black, isort)  
✓ Run test suite with coverage
✓ Validate data schema
✓ Perform security scans
✓ Generate and upload artifacts

CD WORKFLOW should:
✓ Build Docker image
✓ Push to GitHub Container Registry
✓ Deploy to staging environment
✓ Run health checks
✓ Deploy to production (tags only)
✓ Generate deployment reports

ML PIPELINE should:
✓ Validate data quality
✓ Train models (if triggered)
✓ Compare model performance
✓ Upload model artifacts
✓ Generate training reports

MAINTENANCE should:
✓ Run security scans (Safety, Bandit, Semgrep)
✓ Check for dependency updates
✓ Scan Docker images
✓ Generate maintenance reports

echo "
=== Troubleshooting Tips ==="

echo "
If workflows fail:
1. Check the 'Actions' tab for error logs
2. Look for missing files or dependencies
3. Verify environment variables/secrets
4. Check Docker build locally: docker build -t test .
5. Run tests locally: python -m pytest tests/
6. Validate YAML: python .github/validate-workflows.py
