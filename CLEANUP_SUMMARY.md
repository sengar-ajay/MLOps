```

### After:

```python
print("Cleaning up MLOps pipeline temporary files...")
print(f"Removed directory: {item}")
print(f"Failed to remove {item}: {e}")
```

### Before:

```markdown
## MLOps Pipeline - Quick Start Guide

### Files Generated:

- Plain completion messages

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Code now looks like enterprise-grade software
2. **Universal Compatibility**: No Unicode issues across different terminals/systems
3. **Accessibility**: Better for screen readers and text-based interfaces
4. **Consistency**: Uniform status reporting across all scripts
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to read and modify without special characters

## Functionality Preserved

- All scripts work exactly the same
- All verification checks intact
- All error handling preserved
- All documentation content maintained
- All CLI outputs still informative

## Files Unchanged

The following core functionality files were not modified as they didn't contain emojis:

- `src/data_preprocessing.py`
- `src/model_training.py`
- `src/api.py`
- `src/monitoring.py`
- `run_pipeline.py`
- All test files

## Testing

All cleaned scripts have been tested and confirmed working:

- `python verify_setup.py` - All checks pass
- `python cleanup.py` - Cleanup works correctly
- `python demo_api.py` - API demo functions properly
- Documentation remains accurate and helpful

The MLOps pipeline now has a clean, professional appearance while maintaining all functionality.
