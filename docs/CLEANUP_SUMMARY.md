# Special Characters Cleanup Summary

## Overview

All emoji and special characters have been removed from the Python codebase to ensure better compatibility and cleaner code.

## Files Modified

### 1. test_database_logging.py

- Removed all emoji characters (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , )
- Replaced markdown-style bold formatting (**text**) with plain text
- Maintained all functionality while improving readability

### 2. src/database_logging.py

- Changed R² symbol to R2 for ASCII compatibility
- All functionality preserved

### 3. src/model_training.py

- Changed R² symbol to R2 for ASCII compatibility
- Model training output now uses standard ASCII characters

### 4. run_pipeline.py

- Replaced bullet point characters (•) with standard hyphens (-)
- Improved terminal compatibility across different systems

## Changes Made

### Before:

```python
print(" Testing In-Memory Database Logging System")
print(f"RMSE: {metric['rmse']:.4f}, R²: {metric['r2_score']:.4f}")
logger.info("• Health check: http://localhost:5000/health")
```

### After:

```python
print("Testing In-Memory Database Logging System")
print(f"RMSE: {metric['rmse']:.4f}, R2: {metric['r2_score']:.4f}")
logger.info("- Health check: http://localhost:5000/health")
```

## Verification

### Tests Passed:

- ✓ Database logging system functionality
- ✓ Model training pipeline
- ✓ API endpoints
- ✓ All core MLOps functionality

### Character Encoding:

- ✓ All Python files now use only ASCII characters (0x00-0x7F)
- ✓ No emoji or special Unicode characters remain
- ✓ Better compatibility across different terminals and systems

## Benefits

1. **Better Compatibility**: Code now works consistently across all terminal types and operating systems
2. **Cleaner Output**: No dependency on emoji font support
3. **Professional Appearance**: Standard ASCII characters for production environments
4. **Easier Debugging**: No encoding issues when copying/pasting logs
5. **Universal Support**: Works in any text editor or IDE

## Files Not Modified

- Markdown files (.md) retain their formatting as **bold** syntax is standard markdown
- Documentation files maintain their structure
- Configuration files remain unchanged

## Status: Complete ✓

All special characters and emojis have been successfully removed from the Python codebase while maintaining full functionality.
